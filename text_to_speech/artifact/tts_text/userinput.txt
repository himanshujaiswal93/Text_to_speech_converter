No amount of guilt can solve the last and no amount of anxiety can change the future. So start working on your dreams before its too late and only regret is left. If you don't sacrifice for what you want then what you want will become the sacrifice.

Ek cheez hai jisse sab kuch solve ho jayega, woh cheez kya hai? Sangharsh! Tum sangharsh nahi karna chahte. Jo bhi vyakti tumhe lagta hai ki top par pahucha hai, jiska jeevan bada hai, usne apne jeevan mein sangharsh kiya hai. Agar tumhe kuch nahi karna, bas copy-pen lekar baithna hai aur tumhe lagta hai, "Yeh toh bada boring kaam hai," yahi sach hai. Ya toh tum ek common zindagi jee lo—ek ordinary job karo, aaj ke time mein shayad 20-30 hazar ya 35 hazar kamao, aur shayad khush bhi raho. Ho sakta hai tum satisfied bhi raho. Par jo sapne tum dekh rahe ho—ki main jeevan mein bada karunga, IT mein jaunga, crore ka package lunga, samaj ke liye kuch karunga, missile banaunga Bharat ke liye, NASA mein jaunga, ya startup kholunga—agar itne bade sapne hain, toh sangharsh karna padega. Aur roz woh cheez karni padegi jo shayad tumhe pasand bhi na ho. Tumhe unhe pasand karna padega.
